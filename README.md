# Factor-augmented-vector-autoregressive-(FAVAR)-WINRATS-code-package
### Introduction
- *__FAVAR_TWO_STEPS_LYX__* is the package for a *two-step estimation* method of the Factor augmented VAR (FAVAR) models, which is based on *__RATS 10.0__* . In the main code, I replicated the empirical results as in  *Bernanke et al. (2005)* ( *i.g. [Measuring the effects of monetary policy: a factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) approach](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/120/1/387/1931468?redirectedFrom=PDF&casa_token=ZkGknLUtMHwAAAAA:5EU8a8LgKVZAnpkuZ4F4zIIpy3EivyGD6ZuUKopeiPHjX9QmBabc_zysXUBBdpecMHXABLGc5IHB1A)* ).
- Although there has been a opensource *MATLAB* package for a Bayesian likelihood methods and Gibbs sampling estimation for FAVAR model, that is, the [*FAVAR*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzOpR8T359fhOUY5bkh5dkM5bEU/view?resourcekey=0-MfpcA9LYIjBF3YsHYNiWRw) *MATLAB* package written by *Gary Koop*, it has the disadvantages of large time-consuming due to sampling estimation, inflexible result output process and even some bugs. In order to apply FAVAR in my own research, I have written this *RATS* code package.
- Compared with the *MATLAB* package, some <span style="border-bottom:2px;">superiorities</span> of *__FAVAR_TWO_STEPS_LYX__* are listed as below:
