### Introduction
- [*__FAVAR_TWO_STEPS_LYX__*](https://github.com/lyx66/Factor-augmented-vector-autoregressive-FAVAR-WINRATS-code-package-/blob/main/FAVAR_TWO_STEPS_LYX.zip) is the package for a *two-step estimation* method of the Factor augmented VAR (FAVAR) models, which is based on *__RATS 10.0__* . In the main code, I replicated the empirical results as in  *Bernanke et al. (2005)* ( *i.g. [Measuring the effects of monetary policy: a factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) approach](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/120/1/387/1931468?redirectedFrom=PDF&casa_token=ZkGknLUtMHwAAAAA:5EU8a8LgKVZAnpkuZ4F4zIIpy3EivyGD6ZuUKopeiPHjX9QmBabc_zysXUBBdpecMHXABLGc5IHB1A)* ), some of them are showed as below:

###### *Note:* FFR (Federal funds rate) is the proxy variable of Monetary Policy and the only one observable factor in FAVAR model.

- __*Why I write this package?*__
</br>&emsp;&emsp;Although there has been a opensource *MATLAB* package for a Bayesian likelihood methods and Gibbs sampling estimation for FAVAR model yet, that is, the [*FAVAR*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzOpR8T359fhOUY5bkh5dkM5bEU/view?resourcekey=0-MfpcA9LYIjBF3YsHYNiWRw) *MATLAB* package written by *Gary Koop*, it has the disadvantages of large time-consuming due to sampling estimation, inflexible result output process and even some bugs. In order to apply FAVAR in my own research, I have written this *RATS* code package.
- Compared with the *MATLAB* package, some __*superiorities*__ of [*__FAVAR_TWO_STEPS_LYX__*](https://github.com/lyx66/Factor-augmented-vector-autoregressive-FAVAR-WINRATS-code-package-/blob/main/FAVAR_TWO_STEPS_LYX.zip) are listed as below:
</br>&emsp;1.&emsp;Less running time-comsumption.
</br>&emsp;2.&emsp;The program only needs to run once to output the impulse response with error band and variance decomposition results of all series in both [*xdata.xlsx*](https://github.com/lyx66/Factor-augmented-vector-autoregressive-FAVAR-WINRATS-code-package-/blob/main/xdata.XLSX) and [*ydata.xlsx*](https://github.com/lyx66/Factor-augmented-vector-autoregressive-FAVAR-WINRATS-code-package-/blob/main/ydata.XLSX).
</br>&emsp;3.&emsp;The result of *generalized variance decomposition* is available.
</br>&emsp;4.&emsp;Almost no bugs.
</br>&emsp;5.&emsp;It is simple to modify this *RATS* package if you want to apply it to your own reaserch.
- I also provided a Python code ( *i.g.* [__*Draw IRF.ipynb*__](https://github.com/lyx66/Factor-augmented-vector-autoregressive-FAVAR-WINRATS-code-package-/blob/main/Draw%20IRF.ipynb) ) in the file-list to show the IRF results outputed by *RATS* package.
### Files in package [*__FAVAR_TWO_STEPS_LYX__*](https://github.com/lyx66/Factor-augmented-vector-autoregressive-FAVAR-WINRATS-code-package-/blob/main/FAVAR_TWO_STEPS_LYX.zip)
- Main code.rpf
- verd_lyx.src&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- get variance matrix of forecast error
- mcgraphirf_lyx.src&ensp;- get median value and error band of IRF
- kilianbootsetup.src - *two-stages boostrap* for IRF error band, based on [*Kilian(1998)*](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/80/2/218/57059).
### Quick Start
#### *By adjusting the following parameters in Main code.rpf, it is easy to change the purpose of the package:*
- `ny` - Number of Observable Factors.
- `keyvars` - Number of [*xdata.xlsx*](https://github.com/lyx66/Factor-augmented-vector-autoregressive-FAVAR-WINRATS-code-package-/blob/main/xdata.XLSX) series whose IRF and variance decomposition to MP shock you are intrested in. 
- `nf` - Number of Latent factors.
- `ndraws` - Number of draws in two-stages boostrap (for error band of IRF).
- `usegirf` - Whether use *Generalized variance decomption* or not. when `usegirf = 0` , choleky decomposition is used; On the contrary, if `usegirf = 1` , generalized variance decomption will be applied.
#### *Latent factors obtained by PCA should be rotated as below, since "slow-moving" series in xdata by assumption are not affected contemporaneously by FFR.*
```
dec vect[series] PC_new(nf)
dofor i_ = 1 to nf
   linreg(NOPRINT) PC(i_) /
   # constant fyff PC_slow(1) to PC_slow(nf)
   set PC_new(i_) = PC(i_){0} - %BETA(2) * fyff{0}
end dofor i_
```
### Environment
- FAVAR model: *Windows RATS 10.0*
- Graph for IRF: *Python 3.8*

### Tips
- When running the __*Main code.rpf*__, all the other files which is also ziped in [*__FAVAR_TWO_STEPS_LYX__*](https://github.com/lyx66/Factor-augmented-vector-autoregressive-FAVAR-WINRATS-code-package-/blob/main/FAVAR_TWO_STEPS_LYX.zip) should be in the same working directory with it, as well as [*ydata.xlsx*](https://github.com/lyx66/Factor-augmented-vector-autoregressive-FAVAR-WINRATS-code-package-/blob/main/ydata.XLSX) and [*xdata.xlsx*](https://github.com/lyx66/Factor-augmented-vector-autoregressive-FAVAR-WINRATS-code-package-/blob/main/xdata.XLSX).
- For more technical details about *two-step estimation* method of FAVAR model and my package, it's beneficial to read the [*working-paper*](http://www.nber.org/papers/w10220) version of *Bernanke et al. (2005)*, which was published in 2004.
